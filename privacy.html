  <h1>Setlist Streamer – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Effective: October 23, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>Setlist Streamer</strong> is a simple, read‑only Progressive Web App (PWA) that helps you browse and play publicly available concert recordings from <a href="https://archive.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">archive.org</a>. We don’t run user accounts, we don’t collect personal information, and we don’t use ads or analytics SDKs.</p>

  <h2>What data we collect</h2>
  <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or share any personal data.</strong> The app does not ask for your name, email, phone number, payment details, or location.</p>

  <h2>Local storage (on your device)</h2>
  <p>To remember things like your favorites, filters, or recent activity, the app may store small, anonymous settings on your device using browser storage (e.g., <code>localStorage</code> or IndexedDB). This data never leaves your device unless you back it up yourself. You can clear it anytime from your browser or app settings.</p>

  <h2>Network requests to third‑party services</h2>
  <p>The app fetches public content from <a href="https://archive.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">archive.org</a> to display recordings and metadata. While <em>we</em> don’t collect personal data, your device makes standard web requests to those services; those services may receive typical technical information (e.g., IP address, user‑agent) needed to deliver content. Please review their policies for details.</p>

  <h2>App permissions</h2>
  <p>The app does not request access to sensitive device permissions (e.g., contacts, camera, microphone, photos, precise location).</p>

  <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>Setlist Streamer is a general‑audience app and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>Data security</h2>
  <p>Because we don’t run accounts or collect personal data, we don’t maintain user data servers. Any settings saved on your device remain there until you clear them.</p>

  <h2>Data retention & deletion</h2>
  <p>We don’t retain personal data on our servers. Any local settings saved on your device can be removed by clearing the app/site data in your browser or mobile OS settings.</p>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy over time. We’ll post the updated version at the same URL and change the “Effective” date above.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions, please reach out to the developer at <a href="mailto:youremail@example.com">youremail@example.com</a>. Replace this email with your preferred support address before publishing.</p>
